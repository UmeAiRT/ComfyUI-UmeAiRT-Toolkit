# UmeAiRT Toolkit - System Instructions

You are working on the **UmeAiRT Toolkit** for ComfyUI.
**CRITICAL**: This project uses a **Wireless Architecture** based on a global dictionary (`UME_SHARED_STATE`).

## Context Loading
- **ALWAYS** read `AGENTS.md` first if you are new to the session.
- **Refer to** `docs/codemaps/wireless.md` when working with Wireless nodes.

## Rules
1. **Wireless First**: Prefer using `UME_SHARED_STATE` key-value storage over standard node linking.
2. **Naming**: All classes must start with `UmeAiRT_`.
3. **Registration**: Never forget to add new nodes to `__init__.py` mappings.
4. **UI**: If Javascript is needed, place it in `web/` and ensure it's loaded.

## Key Files
- `nodes.py`: Core logic.
- `__init__.py`: Node registration.
